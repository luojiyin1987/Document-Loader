# Technical Documentation: Text Processing System

## Overview
This document describes the text processing system architecture and implementation details. The system is designed to handle various types of documents and provide efficient text processing capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Text Splitter Module
The text splitter module is responsible for breaking down large documents into manageable chunks. It implements several splitting strategies:

- **Character-based splitting**: Splits text based on character count
- **Recursive splitting**: Uses hierarchical approach with separators
- **Token-based splitting**: Splits based on token count rather than characters
- **Semantic splitting**: Uses natural language processing for intelligent splitting
- **Streaming splitting**: Processes text in a memory-efficient streaming manner

### 2. Search Module
The search module provides multiple search strategies:

- **Keyword search**: Simple text matching based on keywords
- **Semantic search**: Uses embeddings to find semantically similar content
- **Hybrid search**: Combines keyword and semantic approaches for better results

### 3. Document Loader
The document loader supports multiple file formats:

- **Text files (.txt)**: Basic text file support
- **PDF files (.pdf)**: PDF document extraction
- **Web pages**: URL-based content loading

## Configuration Options

### Text Splitter Configuration
```python
splitter = TextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,      # Maximum characters per chunk
    chunk_overlap=200,    # Overlap between chunks
    separators=None,      # Custom separators
    keep_separator=True   # Whether to keep separators in chunks
)
```

### Search Configuration
```python
search = HybridSearch(
    keyword_weight=0.4,    # Weight for keyword matching
    semantic_weight=0.6    # Weight for semantic similarity
)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Use streaming splitter for large documents
- Monitor memory usage during processing
- Implement proper cleanup of temporary data

### Processing Speed
- Semantic search is slower but more accurate
- Keyword search is fast but less precise
- Hybrid search provides good balance

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:

- Graceful degradation from semantic to keyword search
- Proper handling of malformed documents
- Memory management for large files
- Encoding detection and conversion

## Best Practices

1. **Choose appropriate chunk size**: Balance between context preservation and memory usage
2. **Use semantic search for concept matching**: When looking for related concepts rather than exact matches
3. **Implement proper error handling**: Always handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages
4. **Test with various document types**: Ensure compatibility with different formats and languages
5. **Monitor performance**: Regular testing and optimization of processing speed

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more file formats (DOCX, XLSX, etc.)
- Advanced NLP capabilities
- Distributed processing for large-scale operations
- Machine learning model integration
- Real-time processing capabilities

## Conclusion

This text processing system provides a robust foundation for document analysis and search operations. It balances performance, accuracy, and memory efficiency to handle various text processing scenarios effectively.
