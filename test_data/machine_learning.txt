Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data.
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for classification and regression tasks.
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data through clustering and dimensionality reduction.
Reinforcement learning trains agents to make decisions through reward-based learning.
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to extract hierarchical features.
